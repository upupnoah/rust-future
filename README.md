# Rust Future Learning and Projects

Welcome to the "Rust Future" repository, a dedicated space for learning Rust and experimenting with various projects built using this powerful programming language. This repository serves as a playground for exploring Rust's capabilities, from web development with Axum to exploring system utilities and networking.

## Overview

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This repository documents my journey with Rust, showcasing projects, examples, and experiments that reflect the language's versatility and my progress as a Rustacean.

## Projects

- **Axum Examples**: Dive into web development with Rust using the Axum framework. From basic setups to more complex applications, explore how Rust can power web services.
- **Basic Rust**: Fundamentals and basic examples of Rust syntax and features. A great starting point for those new to the language.
- **Chat Application**: Implementing a real-time chat application using Rust to understand networking and real-time data transmission.
- **GetInfo**: A utility tool built with Rust for fetching and displaying system or network information.
- **Snake Game**: A simple project to get a taste of game development with Rust, focusing on game loops and user input handling.
- **The Rust Programming Language (The Rust PL)**: Notes, examples, and exercises from "The Rust Programming Language" book, a comprehensive guide to mastering Rust.

## Getting Started
